We report the availability of a new version of the Java based software (GSEA-P 2.0) that represents a major improvement on the previous release through the addition of a leading edge analysis component, seamless integration with the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) and an embedded browser that allows users to search for gene sets and map them to a variety of microarray platform formats. This functionality makes it possible for users to directly import gene sets from MSigDB for analysis with GSEA. We have also improved the visualizations in GSEA-P 2.0 and added links to a new form of concise gene set annotations called Gene Set Cards. These additions, as well as other improvements suggested by over 3500 users who have downloaded the software over the past year have been incorporated into this new release of the GSEA-P Java desktop program.Availability:GSEA-P 2.0 is freely available for academic and commercial users and can be downloaded from http://www.broad.mit.edu/GSEAContact:mesirov@broad.mit.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

L1000FWD enables coloring of signatures by different attributes such as cell type, time point, concentration, as well as drug attributes such as MOA and clinical phase. Signature similarity search is implemented to enable the search for mimicking or opposing signatures given as input of up and down gene sets. Each point on the L1000FWD interactive map is linked to a signature landing page, which provides multifaceted knowledge from various sources about the signature and the drug. Notably such information includes most frequent diagnoses, co-prescribed drugs and age distribution of prescriptions as extracted from the Mount Sinai Health System electronic medical records. Overall, L1000FWD serves as a platform for identifying functions for novel small molecules using unsupervised clustering, as well as for exploring drug MOA.L1000FWD is freely accessible at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/L1000FWD.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. }",

The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of proteinâ€“protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at https://string-db.org/.}",
